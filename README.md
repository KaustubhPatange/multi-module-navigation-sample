# multi-module-test (dagger)

- The approach demonstrates multi-module navigation using vanilla dagger 2.
- Use of multi-map binding for creating `Fragment`s which is used by a custom `FragmentFactory` called `DaggerFragmentFactory` to instantiate `Fragment`s & constructor inject in them.
- Use of AssitedInject when injecting in `ViewModel` & `WorkManager`.
